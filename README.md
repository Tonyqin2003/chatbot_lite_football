# chatbot_lite_football

This is a chatbot that I made for fun. I incoporated corpus that contains football ideologies from best coaches, such as Guardiola and Klopp from different text websites, and fed them to a GPT-4 model. 

And I played around with some basic flask and html, and tried out frontend for the first time. Frontend codes are also uploaded to this repo.
